## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies 

**Frontend: React.js**

**Backend: Django**

**Database: PostgreSQL**

**Tools:**
- **Celery**: An asynchronous task queue/job queue for managing and executing background tasks.
- **Redis**: A fast, in-memory data structure store used as a message broker for Celery.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Architecture

I utilize a layered architecture in my backend, featuring two primary modules: Image Processing and Long Running Task. Each module is structured with its own:

- **ORM (Object Relational Mapper)**
- **Repository Class**
- **Service Class**
- **REST Controller (View)**

### Background Tasks

I have a system of REST APIs that allow users to:
- Submit tasks
- Get progress updates
- Stop a task

### API Endpoints

1. **Task Creation Endpoint**
   - Receives the task in the URL and an array of image IDs in the request body as JSON.
   
2. **Task Progress Endpoint**
   - Receives a task ID in the URL. This endpoint checks if the task exists in the database. If not, it returns a not found error code; otherwise, it returns the corresponding progress to the client.
   
3. **Delete Endpoint**
   - Receives a task ID in the URL. This endpoint checks if the task exists in the Redis server. If it does, it sends a revoke signal to stop the task; otherwise, it returns a not found error code.
